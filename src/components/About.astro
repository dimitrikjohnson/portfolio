            I'm a developer who's passionate about bringing ideas to life with my code. For me, the best part of development is problem 
            solving â€” taking an idea, breaking it down into pieces, and building a real, useful product.
        </p>
        <p class={spaceBetweenParas}>
            I'm currently a web developer at 
            <a href="https://millercenter.org/" title="(opens in new tab)" target="_blank">University of Virginia's Miller Center</a>,
            where I manage and build features for our Drupal website. Alongside frontend development, I also manage SEO (search engine 
            optimization) and ensure our site meets web accessibility standards.
        </p>
        <p class={spaceBetweenParas}>
            In my free time, I've worked with technologies like Next.js, Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to turn personal ideas into 
            real-world applications. I'm especially proud of personal projects like <a href="https://bigfootball.co" title="(opens in new tab)" target="_blank">Big Football</a>, 
            which combines my passion for football and development by delivering dynamic NFL content through dashboards that feature team and player 
            statistics, game schedules, standings, and rosters.
        </p>

            When I'm not writing code, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, obesessing over my fantasy football team, and going for 
            walks to recharge.
